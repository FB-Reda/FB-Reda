# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=fb-reda.fb-reda)

I'm a Chicago based Software Engineer previously working for the Product Engineering team at Donnelley Financial Solutions.  For school I completed my degree in Computer Engineering at Marquette University with a focus in Intelligent Systems.  In my free time I work on the Chicago International Model United Nations conference as the Undersecretary-General of Media and as a member of the engineering department.

Most of my projects on here are unfortunately private, but I'm planning on going back and adding some documentation to my old code and making it public.
